I love the feeling of starting afresh, growing and setting new intentions and goals. I was that kid who liked a new school year purely to buy a bunch of new stationary.\nI’m a very goal-oriented person, a facet of ADHD that I actually really like. But - and here’s the important bit - they need to be goals I can actually achieve, or my motivation goes out of the window.\n2025 was a a very fun year, overall. Career-wise, I got promoted and invested more time and effort into the community. In my personal life, I found my partner in April and moved 4 hours across the Scottish border to be with him. There were some scary times too, but that’s a little too personal for my second ever blog.\nEvery year, I have a big ol’ journalling session to reflect on the year and figure out what I want to take with me into the next and what I want to leave behind. So, I thought I’d share some of these with you, around health and hobbies, to help hold myself accountable.\nRun a 10k race I’ve dabbled in running but never stuck with it for long enough to be comfortable doing more than 5k. I want to build running into my routine this year! Get back into dancing I’ve dance from the age of 3 up until 23, but haven’t in the past few years. I’d love to get back to dancing again, for my body but also for my mind. Read 20 books I’m an avid bookworm but haven’t ever tracked how many books I read. I’ll be using Storygraph to gather aalll the data! Compete in a poetry slam I’m also a writer, and love reading at poetry open mics - but the idea of competing in a slam terrifies me! But, I remember feeling that way about public speaking, which I now love. Have my prose published I’ve had my poetry published a couple of times, but haven’t ever submitted my prose/fiction, mostly due to imposter syndrome! Hopefully, I’ll have my flash fiction or short story in a lit mag this year. These are very tangible goals, which is partly what gives me motivation, but it’s also very easy for them to give me a level of dread if I feel like I’m behind where I ‘should’ be. So, these goals will be combined with intentions - softer, more mindful ideas that nudge me in a more intentional direction. These are a tad too personal to share, but I thought it was worth mentioning as I think they’re just as important!\n","date":"9 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/2026-accountability/","section":"Blog","summary":"One thing you should know about me: I love new years.

Prior to that, I worked on my own personal brand, and prior to that, have been proofing and editing my boyfriend’s personal brand for longer than we’ve been together. What I’m saying is that this blog is a long time coming!\nMy journey with personal branding - and marketing as a whole - is a little unconventional. Which, if you know me, fits in with my brand in a lovely ironic way.\nI finished my degree (in Film and English Literature) during covid, and wanted to work in TV production. Except, there was no TV in production because of covid. So, I started applying for marketing jobs, knowing that I have a good eye for design and I’m a good writer. I happened to get a job at a data consultancy (Simpson Associates), throwing me into a world of jargon I didn’t understand. After a couple of years there, I moved to Advancing Analytics, where I’ve been for 3 years. Somewhere along the way, I was also diagnosed with ADHD, changed my pronouns, and moved to Glasgow.\nIt was at Advancing that I started speaking at data conferences, which was a surprising turn of events for the kid who used to shy away from any and all attention. But I love it. My first talk was at SQLBits, and I went on to speak at Fabric February and FabCon Europe twice. Clearly I don’t do things by halves.\nMy sessions have always been on two pretty personal things - neurodivergence and LGBTQ+ topics. I’m very open about both of these things, and have long championed DEI, so it made a lot of sense for me. But despite loving being on a stage, I always had a mental block around LinkedIn.\nI used to hate it as a platform - until the platform changed. It used to feel fake and sales-y, then (thanks to a collective move away from X) it turned into an actual community space. A space where I wanted to spend my time. Despite not using it myself, I’d always kept up with best practices and trends, and helped my boyfriend with his personal brand (he’s been a champion of a personal brand far longer than me!).\nThen after FabCon Europe 2025, I hit post. And it was fun.\nMy conference sessions meant I already had personal brand of neurodivergence and queerness, with values that were inherent to me as a person. Completely by accident!\nThen I realised I wanted to create carousels and graphics, and had absolutely no template. So, my personal brand got some colours and a pattern, and I started being more intentional with posting and sharing my knowledge and opinions.\nInstead of starting by building a personal brand and then writing conference sessions around it, I did the opposite - and to be honest, I think a lot of people do the same. Personal branding sounds a little wanky and fluffy, and personally, I think many people who don’t have a personal brand have a “this has worked for me so far, why would I change it” perspective. But this doesn’t take into account the benefits personal branding can have, with relatively little effort.\nThis blog will be a place for me to share long form content on personal branding, as well as digital marketing as a whole. And who knows, maybe you’ll get an insight into my notes app too.\n","date":"9 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/an-introduction/","section":"Blog","summary":"I’m on a packed train, typing in my notes app. My notes app is full of lists, half-baked ideas, and half-written poems, but maybe that’s a blog for another day.","title":"An Introduction","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"9 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/intro/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Intro","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/notes/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Notes","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tag1/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tag1","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tag2/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tag2","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/template-rename/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Title of the article/post","type":"blog"},{"content":"Let’s be real, ‘personal branding’ kiiinda sounds like something a wanky FinTech founder would come up with, a new buzzword to make ‘posting on LinkedIn’ sound snazzier, and gatekeep it in the process.\nI’d love to come up with a new name, but alas, ‘personal branding’ actually fits the bill pretty well. Let me explain why.\nFirstly, what is ‘branding’?\r#\rLet’s get the basics down first. Branding and marketing are often used interchangeably, and although their linked, they’re pretty different.\nYou might be wondering what this has to do with you posting on LinkedIn, but I’m getting there - patience.\nMarketing is the strategy and tactics used to generate leads and convert them to sales. It’s the ‘how-to’, the ROI, the campaigns, the promotion. Branding is the foundations - who you are and what you stand for. It’s the long game of earning trust and increasing reputation.\nBranding includes:\nYour visual identity - logo, colours, fonts Your tone of voice Your values and personality Your mission statement How does this relate to you?\r#\rI get it - you’re a human, not a company. Surely you don’t need a logo or a mission statement?\nI beg to differ. If you’re active in a professional community, especially on LinkedIn but also speaking or attending conferences and networking, it applies to you. I’m not saying you need a logo, but I’d argue everything else is necessary.\nPersonal branding is the\n","date":"9 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/what-is-personal-branding/","section":"Blog","summary":"Let’s be real, ‘personal branding’ kiiinda sounds like something a wanky FinTech founder would come up with, a new buzzword to make ‘posting on LinkedIn’ sound snazzier, and gatekeep it in the process.\n","title":"What actually is ‘Personal Branding’?","type":"blog"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
