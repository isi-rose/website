I’m on a packed train, typing in my notes app. My notes app is full of lists, half-baked ideas, and half-written poems, but maybe that’s a blog for another day.

I recently did an internal workshop on personal branding. Prior to that, I worked on my own personal brand, and prior to *that*, have been proofing and editing my boyfriend’s personal brand for longer than we’ve been together. What I’m saying is that this blog is a long time coming!

My journey with personal branding - and marketing as a whole - is a little unconventional. Which, if you know me, fits in with my brand in a lovely ironic way. 

I finished my degree (in Film and English Literature) during covid, and wanted to work in TV production. Except, there was no TV in production because of covid. So, I started applying for marketing jobs, knowing that I have a good eye for design and I’m a good writer. I happened to get a job at a data consultancy (Simpson Associates), throwing me into a world of jargon I didn’t understand. After a couple of years there, I moved to Advancing Analytics, where I’ve been for 3 years. Somewhere along the way, I was also diagnosed with ADHD, changed my pronouns, and moved to Glasgow.

It was at Advancing that I started speaking at data conferences, which was a surprising turn of events for the kid who used to shy away from any and all attention. But I *love* it. My first talk was at SQLBits, and I went on to speak at Fabric February and FabCon Europe twice. Clearly I don’t do things by halves. 

My sessions have always been on two pretty personal things - neurodivergence and LGBTQ+ topics. I’m very open about both of these things, and have long championed DEI, so it made a lot of sense for me. But despite loving being on a stage, I always had a mental block around LinkedIn. 

I used to hate it as a platform - until the platform changed. It used to feel fake and sales-y, then (thanks to a collective move away from X) it turned into an actual community space. A space where I wanted to spend my time. Despite not using it myself, I’d always kept up with best practices and trends, and helped my boyfriend with his personal brand (he’s been a champion of a personal brand far longer than me!). 

Then after FabCon Europe 2025, I hit post. And it was *fun*.

My conference sessions meant I already had personal brand of neurodivergence and queerness, with values that were inherent to me as a person. Completely by accident!

Then I realised I wanted to create carousels and graphics, and had absolutely no template. So, my personal brand got some colours and a pattern, and I started being more intentional with posting and sharing my knowledge and opinions. 

Instead of starting by building a personal brand and then writing conference sessions around it, I did the opposite - and to be honest, I think a lot of people do the same. Personal branding sounds a little wanky and fluffy, and personally, I think many people who don’t have a personal brand have a “this has worked for me so far, why would I change it” perspective. But this doesn’t take into account the benefits personal branding can have, with relatively little effort. 

This blog will be a place for me to share long form content on personal branding, as well as digital marketing as a whole. And who knows, maybe you’ll get an insight into my notes app too.
