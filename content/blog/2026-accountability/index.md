# 2026 Accountability

One thing you should know about me: I *love* new years. I love the feeling of starting afresh, growing and setting new intentions and goals. I was that kid who liked a new school year purely to buy a bunch of new stationary. 

I’m a very goal-oriented person, a facet of ADHD that I actually really like. But - and here’s the important bit - they need to be goals I can *actually* achieve, or my motivation goes out of the window. 

2025 was a a very fun year, overall. Career-wise, I got promoted and invested more time and effort into the community. In my personal life, I found my partner in April and moved 4 hours across the Scottish border to be with him. There were some scary times too, but that’s a little too personal for my second ever blog. 

Every year, I have a big ol’ journalling session to reflect on the year and figure out what I want to take with me into the next and what I want to leave behind. So, I thought I’d share some of these with you, around health and hobbies, to help hold myself accountable. 

1. Run a 10k race
    1. I’ve dabbled in running but never stuck with it for long enough to be comfortable doing more than 5k. I want to build running into my routine this year!
2. Get back into dancing
    1. I’ve dance from the age of 3 up until 23, but haven’t in the past few years. I’d love to get back to dancing again, for my body but also for my mind.
3. Read 20 books
    1. I’m an avid bookworm but haven’t ever tracked how many books I read. I’ll be using Storygraph to gather aalll the data!
4. Compete in a poetry slam
    1. I’m also a writer, and love reading at poetry open mics - but the idea of competing in a slam terrifies me! But, I remember feeling that way about public speaking, which I now love. 
5. Have my prose published
    1. I’ve had my poetry published a couple of times, but haven’t ever submitted my prose/fiction, mostly due to imposter syndrome! Hopefully, I’ll have my flash fiction or short story in a lit mag this year. 
    

These are very tangible goals, which is partly what gives me motivation, but it’s also very easy for them to give me a level of dread if I feel like I’m behind where I ‘should’ be. So, these goals will be combined with intentions - softer, more mindful ideas that nudge me in a more intentional direction. These are a tad too personal to share, but I thought it was worth mentioning as I think they’re just as important!
