# About Me
I'm Isi, a poetry-writing, nature-loving digital marketer who can't seem to keep their hair the same for more than a few months. (Genuinely, every time I speak at a conference, I seem to have new hair.)

Described by my friends as an 'agent of mischief', I spend my weekends with my head in a book, my feet in walking boots, and a plethora of cat hair on whatever I'm wearing. 

I've worked in marketing for the past 5 years, and despite never intending to work in data, I actually quite like it here. Marketing wise, I love good branding, video as a format, and doing exactly what everyone else doesn't do. 

Sitting somewhere between a journal and a knowledge hub, this website will reflect the blurry line between professional and personal that has somehow become my niche. You'll find posts on digital marketing and branding, ADHD, and notes-app-style ponderings. I may even throw in a poem or two.
